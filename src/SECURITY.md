# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the Plugged.in Random Number Generator MCP Server:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features

This MCP server implements several security measures to ensure safe and secure random number generation:

### Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generation

- **CSPRNG Implementation**: All random number generation uses Node.js built-in `crypto` module functions (`randomBytes`, `randomInt`, `randomUUID`)
- **Entropy Sources**: Leverages operating system entropy sources for seed material
- **No Predictable Patterns**: Generated numbers are cryptographically secure and suitable for security-sensitive applications

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Parameter Validation**: All input parameters are validated against expected types and ranges
- **Range Checking**: Numeric inputs are checked against minimum and maximum allowed values
- **Array Validation**: Choice arrays are validated for proper structure and content
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking for additional safety

### Resource Protection

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in limits on generation counts prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Memory Management**: Efficient buffer handling prevents memory-based attacks
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive system information

### Protocol Security

- **MCP Compliance**: Full adherence to Model Context Protocol security guidelines
- **JSON-RPC Security**: Proper handling of JSON-RPC requests and responses
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are sanitized before processing

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to: security@plugged.in (if available) or create a private security advisory on GitHub
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress toward a fix
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Vulnerability Severity Levels

We classify vulnerabilities using the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: Vulnerabilities that could lead to complete system compromise
- **High**: Vulnerabilities that could lead to significant data exposure or system access
- **Medium**: Vulnerabilities with limited impact or requiring specific conditions
- **Low**: Minor vulnerabilities with minimal security impact

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using this MCP server, follow these security best practices:

### Deployment Security

- **Network Security**: Deploy the server in a secure network environment
- **Access Control**: Limit access to the server to authorized clients only
- **Monitoring**: Monitor server logs for unusual activity or errors
- **Updates**: Keep the server updated to the latest version

### Integration Security

- **Client Validation**: Validate that MCP clients are authorized and trusted
- **Request Monitoring**: Monitor requests for unusual patterns or excessive usage
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in client applications
- **Logging**: Log security-relevant events for audit purposes

### Operational Security

- **Regular Updates**: Keep Node.js and dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- **Security Scanning**: Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- **Incident Response**: Have an incident response plan for security events

## Security Considerations for Random Number Usage

### Appropriate Use Cases

This server is suitable for:
- Cryptographic key generation
- Session token creation
- Password generation
- Security-sensitive random data
- Gaming and simulation applications
- Statistical sampling

### Inappropriate Use Cases

Do not use this server for:
- Deterministic testing (use seeded PRNGs instead)
- Applications requiring specific statistical distributions beyond uniform
- High-frequency trading where microsecond timing matters
- Applications requiring hardware-based true random number generators

### Entropy Considerations

- The server relies on operating system entropy sources
- In virtualized environments, ensure adequate entropy is available
- For high-volume applications, monitor entropy pool status
- Consider using hardware random number generators for maximum security

## Compliance and Standards

This server follows industry security standards and best practices:

- **NIST Guidelines**: Follows NIST SP 800-90A recommendations for random number generation
- **OWASP**: Implements OWASP secure coding practices
- **Node.js Security**: Follows Node.js security best practices
- **MCP Protocol**: Adheres to Model Context Protocol security specifications
